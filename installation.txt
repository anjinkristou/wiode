WIODE System Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Upload all files and folders to your server.

2. Ensure write capabilities on the following:
    /config.php
    /backups
    /workspace

3. Create a MySQL database.

4. In a web browser go to http://[PATH_TO_WIODE]
   Follow the steps and input required information to complete the installation.

5. When installation is done you will be able to log in with the following:
    Login:     user
    Password:  welcome

6. Upon first login you will be prompted to create a project. Note that project names
   must only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens.

7. The system setup is complete, and if all steps were followed you should now have a
   working IDE.



Notes:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   -In order to use the "Backup" function in projects your host must allow the PHP exec() 
    command and have the ability to use the "tar" and "gzip" commands.
    If you have issues with this or your host won't allow it, we suggest looking into the
    PECL zip extension (and modifying /system/php/modules/project_actions.php "Backup" 
    section).
    
   -If you install WIODE locally and try to access it through http://localhost/ you may get
    an error regarding "Undefined Index". This is due to the fact that the session/cookie 
    variables can cause problems on some browsers through the localhost.

   -It is STRONGLY recommended that you remove the /system/install.php file after you
    have succesfully installed the system.
